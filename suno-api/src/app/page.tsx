## üëã Introduction

Suno.ai v3 is an amazing AI music service. Although the official API is not yet available, we couldn't wait to integrate its capabilities somewhere.

We discovered that some users have similar needs, so we decided to open-source this project, hoping you'll like it.

We update quickly, please star us on Github:  [github.com/gcui-art/suno-api](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api) ‚≠ê

## üåü Features

- Perfectly implements the creation API from \`app.suno.ai\`
- Compatible with the format of OpenAI‚Äôs \`/v1/chat/completions\` API.
- Automatically keep the account active.
- Supports \`Custom Mode\`
- One-click deployment to Vercel
- In addition to the standard API, it also adapts to the API Schema of Agent platforms like GPTs and Coze, so you can use it as a tool/plugin/Action for LLMs and integrate it into any AI Agent.
- Permissive open-source license, allowing you to freely integrate and modify.
